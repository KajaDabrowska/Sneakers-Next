# Sneakers e-commerce app with React and Typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

- Design based on a [Front End Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6)

- Loosely based on a [React Coure](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/)

- Log in functionality with Firebase

- Cart functionality

- Data persistence with Local Storage

- Built with accessibility in mind

- State managed with Redux Toolkit

- Made with typescript

### What I've learned

- How to use the dialog element

```jsx
<dialog ref="{dialogRef}" className="dialog">
  <button className="dialog__close-btn" onClick="{toggleModal}">
    <img src="{closeIcon}" alt="close modal" className="dialog__close-icon" />
  </button>

  <ImageCarousel
    imageUrl="{imageUrl}"
    imagesArray="{images}"
    toggleModal="{toggleModal}"
    isModal="{true}"
  />
</dialog>
```

- How to use useRef and forwardRef

```jsx
const CartIcon = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement>((props, ref) => {
    //...
});

// In different component:
const btnRef = React.createRef<HTMLButtonElement>();

return (
    <CartIcon ref={btnRef} />
)
```

- Got just a little better with TS

```tsx
export const CartContext = createContext({
  cartItems: [] as ItemType[],
  //...
});

type ButtonProps = {
  btnType?: BtnTypes;
} & ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>;

const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, btnType, ...otherProps }) => {
  //...
};

export const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUser: (state, action: PayloadAction<UserDataType | null>) => {
      state.currentUser = action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```

- You can't place pseudo elements direclty on imgs
  From [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before).
  "Note: The pseudo-elements generated by ::before and ::after are contained by the element's formatting box, and thus don't apply to replaced elements such as <img>, or to <br> elements."
